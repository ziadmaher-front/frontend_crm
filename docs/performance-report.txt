Performance Test Report

Scope:
- Dashboard load and render timings (instrumented via performanceMonitor marks)
- API data loading timing on Dashboard (isLoading transitions)
- Production build artifact sizes (bundle analyzer configured via rollup-plugin-visualizer)

Key Findings (current run):
- Production build completed successfully with no runtime errors in preview.
- Largest chunks:
  - dashboard chunk: ~3.07 MB (gzip ~970 KB)
  - chart-vendor (recharts): ~479 KB (gzip ~120 KB)
  - EnhancedAIDashboard: ~228 KB (gzip ~71 KB)
  - react-vendor: ~140 KB (gzip ~45 KB)
  - ui-vendor: ~128 KB (gzip ~42 KB)
- Manual 'analytics' chunk was removed to fix a production runtime error (Cannot access 'v' before initialization). After removal, preview runs cleanly.

Instrumentation Added:
- Dashboard mount timing: mark('dashboard-mount') and measure after first paint.
- Dashboard data loading timing: mark('dashboard-data-loading') on loading start; measure when loading completes.

How to View Metrics:
- Use PerformanceMonitor UI at route /PerformanceMonitor for an overview of simulated metrics.
- In code, import performanceMonitor from '@/utils/performanceMonitor' and call performanceMonitor.generateReport() or exportMetrics() where needed.
- Bundle analyzer report is generated at dist/stats.html after build. Open the production preview and navigate to /stats.html.

Next Optimization Opportunities:
- Split Dashboard into more lazy-loaded sections to reduce the main chunk size.
- Consider moving heavy charts behind Suspense with lazy imports.
- Review recharts usage; defer loading of non-critical charts.
- Evaluate cache lifetimes in react-query to reduce redundant fetches.
