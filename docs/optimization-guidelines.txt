System Optimization Updates and Usage Guidelines

Summary of Changes:
- Fixed invalid hook call and Babel parser issues in EnhancedNotifications by removing erroneous try/catch around hooks.
- Added safe fallbacks in useRealTimeNotifications to prevent undefined actions from causing errors.
 - Consolidated toast system to shadcn/ui implementation (src/components/ui/use-toast.jsx) and mounted a global Toaster portal.
- Installed @mui/material, @mui/icons-material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled to resolve missing imports used by EnhancedAIDashboard and AISystemStatus.
- Removed custom manual chunk 'analytics' from vite.config.js to resolve a production runtime error related to initialization order.
- Added performance instrumentation marks to Dashboard for mount and data loading timings.

Usage Guidelines:
 - Toasts: import { useToast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast' and call toast({ title, description }). Ensure <Toaster /> is mounted once (already added in App.jsx).
- Real-time notifications: use useRealTimeNotifications from '@/hooks/useEnhancedBusinessLogic' and rely on safe fallbacks if actions are not initialized.
- Performance monitoring: import performanceMonitor from '@/utils/performanceMonitor' to mark/measure critical paths; visit /PerformanceMonitor for an overview.
- Chunking: avoid manual chunking for interdependent components unless verified safe; let Vite manage chunking for complex feature sets.
- MUI Components: ensure @emotion packages remain installed; prefer consistent UI libs to avoid bundle bloat.

Recommendations:
- Gradually code-split Dashboard and analytics-heavy pages.
- Use Suspense and lazy() for non-critical widgets.
- Track API timing with usePerformanceMonitor or useOptimizedQuery for key endpoints.
